##### The standard Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, is the Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, Type-1.
##### I have introduced a new algorithm flow for the Implicit-Response Residual Space Mapping Optimization, called Implict-Response Residual Space Mapping, Type-2

*This package contains my independent implementation of the Cheese-Cutting Illustration of Space Mapping Optimization using MATLAB.*
